# API Test Automation - Multi-language Scaffold

This repo contains **language-specific scaffolds** for API test automation in **Java**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**.  
Each sub-folder is a ready-to-start project skeleton (dependencies, config, README) so you can pick your preferred stack.

Folders:
- `java/` — Maven scaffold (JUnit + RestAssured + jqwik)
- `python/` — pytest scaffold (requests + hypothesis)
- `javascript/` — Node scaffold (jest + supertest)

Each scaffold includes a README with run instructions and example test/placeholder files.
